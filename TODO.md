## Long-term TODO
- [ ] Add floating labels on diagram for non-student nodes
- [ ] Add option to see where QERMies go after graduation
- [ ] Clicking a node filters to just them and their connections. Clicking same node again unfilters.
- [ ] Tooltip contains image, blurb, link
- [ ] Add faculty view (see #19)
- [ ] Rename repo and add users (see #20)


## Done
 - [x] Change classifications in "Ecosystems" datafile to identify QERMies strictly by ecosystems. Suggest to remove distinction between ecology and resource management and instead provide greater resolution on ecosystem with groups such as
  - 	marine
  - 	freshwater
  - 	epidemiology/global health/human ecology
  - 	urban ecology
  - 	forestry
  - 	wildlife ecology
- [x] Poll current students, alumni and update data
- [x] When filtering on current/alumni, eliminate nodes/links unconnected to the filtered nodes
- [x] Add "status" field to quant methods and ecosystems datafile
- [x] Remove playcount field from all datafiles
- [x] Remvoe "sort" area from webpage
- [x] Austin: update ecosystems datafile
- [x] Cole: update quant. methods datafile
- [x] Nick: update website
- [x] Make student nodes distinguishable from non-student nodes (ex: diff shape or opacity)
- [x] Nick: add instructions for running the visualization
- [x] Add legend for QERMies' department colors
- [x] On search: make matching nodes more distinguishable from non-matching nodes
