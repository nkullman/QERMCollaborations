## Short-term TODO
 - [ ] Make student nodes distinguishable from non-student nodes (ex: diff shape or opacity)
 - [ ] Add legend for QERMies' department colors
 - [ ] Change classifications in "Ecosystems" datafile to identify QERMies strictly by ecosystems. Suggest to remove distinction between ecology and resource management and instead provide greater resolution on ecosystem with groups such as
  - 	marine
  - 	freshwater
  - 	epidemiology/global health/human ecology
  - 	urban ecology
  - 	forestry
  - 	wildlife ecology
 
 
## Long-term TODO
- [ ] On search: make matching nodes more distinguishable from non-matching nodes
- [ ] Add floating labels on diagram for non-student nodes
- [ ] Poll current students, alumni and update data 
- [ ] Add option to see where QERMies go after graduation
