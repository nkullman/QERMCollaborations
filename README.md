[Beta] Network graph of QERM graduate student collaborations
=================================
The goal of this visualization is to demonstrate the interdisciplinary
nature of the program.

This project was adapted from [this tutorial](
http://flowingdata.com/2012/08/02/how-to-make-an-interactive-network-visualization/) by Jim Vallandingham.


## Running Instructions
Access our visualization [here](http://nkullman.github.io/QERMCollaborations/) or clone this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &` (for Python 2) or `python -m http.server 8888 &` (for Python 3), and then access the visualization from http://localhost:8888/

We recommend using a modern browser to view the visualization, such as Chrome or FireFox.
